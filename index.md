Hello, there! I’m Thamara come from Brazil. 

I was born in Passos, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 1991. I received my bachelor’s degree in information systems, in January, 2013, from the State University of Minas Gerais (UEMG) at Passos - Campus at FESP, Brazil. And March, 2013, I started my master’s degree at Federal University of São Carlos (UFScar), SP, working at the “Advanced Interaction Laboratory” (LIA), research related with Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). January, 2014, I went to the Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, do research at the Faculty of Computer Science, working at the “Graphics and Experiential Media (GEM) Lab”, conducting project about privacy, as part of my Master’s Degree.


I'm not perfect. Just fixing my own errors, and learning more, everyday.
