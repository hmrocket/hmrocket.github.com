Hello, there! Iâ€™m Thamara come from Brazil. I'm 23 year old. Was researcher at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Started programming as desktop developer, from Pascal until C#. Now, in process to be full stack developer. Learning design, mobile and web at the same time. Creating app's, mockup's, and web app's. I like to use Node js, phonegap, cordova, angular, ionic, firebase, mongodb. 

Enjoy seeing <a href="../projects/index.html"><strong>my Projects</strong></a>. Portfolio front-end, just sample <a href="http://bit.ly/portfoliofrontend">portfolio front-end. </a> Or my<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8cWi3slAjyXRWUwbFh2OU82RU0"><strong> curriculum, also!</strong></a> I love challenges. Always doing the "best possible". Fixing my own errors.   

Because... "Some infinities are bigger than other infinities." (2014, T.F.O.S). Pardon me, but I'm not perfect!
