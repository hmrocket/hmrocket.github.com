Hello, there! I’m Thamara come from Brazil. 

I was born in Passos, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 1991. I received my bachelor’s degree in information systems, in January, 2013, from the State University of Minas Gerais (UEMG) at Passos, Brazil, and March, 2013, I started my master’s degree at Federal University of São Carlos (UFScar), São Paulo, Brazil, working at the “Advanced Interaction Laboratory” (LIA), research with focus in concepts related a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). January, 2014, I went to the Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, do research at the Faculty of Computer Science, working at the “Graphics and Experiential Media (GEM) Lab”, conducting project about privacy, as part of my Master’s Degree.

Enjoy seeing <a href="../projects/index.html"><strong>projects</strong></a>. Front-end <a href="http://bit.ly/portfoliofrontend">portfolio</a>, just samples. Or my<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8cWi3slAjyXRWUwbFh2OU82RU0"><strong> curriculum, also!</strong></a> I love challenges. Always doing the "best possible". Fixing my own errors.   

Because... "Some infinities are bigger than other infinities." (2014, T.F.O.S). Pardon me, but I'm not perfect!
